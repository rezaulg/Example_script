# Example_script
This repository contains a few example scripts that I developed while working on different projects. This includes my scripts used for downloading and post-processing of seasonal forecasts under the purview of the PIRE project at UConn plus the river discharge data pulled from the NCAR GLADE repository and auto-retrieval from USGS stream gauges.
